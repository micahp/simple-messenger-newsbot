# Actions on Google API.AI Boilerplate

This project is a boilerplate to help get you started building your own [Actions on Google](https://developers.google.com/actions/) that work with API.AI. This code will act as the [webhook fulfillment](https://docs.api.ai/docs/webhook) endpoint. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live. Click the Show button to see your live endpoint URL.

Glitch is a developer playground that lets you code a real web-app without the slow setup and deployment steps.
